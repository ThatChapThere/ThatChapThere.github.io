				0.7
			</H2>
			<LI>
				<A href='chess070.html'>v0.7.0</A><P>Fairly big update. Now doesn't crash slow browsers, and uses setInterval rather than a loop, meaning it can be improved in rating soon as well. Has a bar showing thought progress. Board replaced with snazzier picture. Casling bug discovered by Chess.com&copy; user Tapani fixed. Apparently old promotion bug fixed. Now has version number as html filename / URL. More code formatting. </P>
			</LI>
			<LI>
				<A href='chess071.html'>v0.7.1</A><P>Fixed bug where it would freeze when it only had one legal move. Fixed some AI bugs which were decreasing move quality. Now understands checkmate again (0.7 overhaul didn't implement this perfectly). No longer has "Chess" as a H1 Header (This should be faily obvious). Fixed and improved notation divider from "!DOCTYPE" HTML bugs introduced around 0.5.1. New logo! Piece being moved no longer leaves a trail, because every time I let someone try it out, they spend half an hour drawing pictures and filling the board with blackness XD.</P>
			</LI>
			<!--<LI>
				<A href='chess072.html'>v0.7.2</A><P>Brought back piece trail because of it not working in slow brosers. Added a debuggy thingummy for interested nerds. Added two-click moves.</P>
