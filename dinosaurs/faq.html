		FAQs
	</h1>
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		What is <a href="tree.html">this thing</a>?
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		This is a rough phylogenetic tree for as a many dinosaurs as possible.
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		What was the inspiration?
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		<a href="http://www.onezoom.org/">Onezoom.org</a> was the inspiration. The idea is to have a zoomable
		evolutionary tree for dinosaurs.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		How can I get involved?
	</h2>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		<a href="contribute.html">Click here</a> to find out. You can contribute pictures, dinosaur details and phylogenies for specific taxa.
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		Will I be credited?
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		For images, yes, and copyrighted. For details/phylogeny, you'll
		be credited on the <a href="credits.html">credits page</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		I'm not happy with the Attribution-ShareAlike licence, so can I have a different copyright model?
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		Perhaps. We'll have to discuss this over email though.

	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		What creatures are involved?
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		Non-avian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur">dinosaurs</a>. 
		That is, the common ancestor of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_sparrow">Passer
		domesticus</a></i>, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceratops">Triceratops horridus</a></i> and 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplodocus"><i>Diplodocus carnegii</i></a> and all
		its descendants excluding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avialae">Avialae</a> (The most inclusive clade including <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_sparrow">Passer domesticus</a></i> but not <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinonychus">Deinonychus antirrhopus</a></i> or <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troodon">Troodon formosus</a></i>).
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		What's this "Ornithoscelida" thing all about?
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		While not yet a foregone conclusion, it seems quite likely at this
		point that Theropods do not belong in Saurischia, and are in
		fact more closely related to Ornithischians. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithoscelida">Relevant Wikipedia article</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		Will you ever add other prehistoric reptiles like crocodilians
		or pterosaurs? What about <i>all</i> dinosaurs (extinct and exant birds)?
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		Not at the moment. But the layout is pretty malleable, so it's a future possibility. No real plans for this yet though.
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		How do you decide on how to lay out the tree? Why are no scientific papers referenced? Isn't Wikipedia an unreliable source for classification?
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		This is not intended to be a scientific work. It's intended to
		be an informal tree/educational tool to help visualise dinosaur
		evoulution. However, I have every intention of <b>after a rough tree 
		has been completed</b> filling in important taxa with <b>properly researched 
		and referenced phlogenies</b>. This will be some months from now
		however.
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		My question isn't on this page, so what do I do now?
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		Easy! Just send it to the above email adress. If your question is good enough, then it will be added to this page.
