		Contribute Artwork
	</h1>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		The ThatChapThere dinosaur project really needs some nice
		artwork to add to the visual appeal. Anyone can contribute, and
		they will be credited under the name of their choice and with a 
		link to their site/page. It will be copyrighted under the
		Creative Commons
		<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">
			Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)</a>
		licence. Almost any format/medium will be accepted, from
		paintings, drawings or digital art to photographs of models. To
		contribute, send an email with your image attatched to
		<a href="mailto:ThatChapThere@outlook.com">
			ThatChapThere@outlook.com</a>
		with the name of the dinosaur genus and your preferred name and
		website/deviantart e.t.c url. Ideally go to
		<a href="tree.html">
			the project</a>
		and choose a dinosaur which currently only has a silluette, or
		use the <a href="reference.html">reference</a> to find a genus
		saying "image not drawn". If you have any more questions go to
		the <a href="faq.html">FAQ page</a>.
		Images must meet the following criteria:
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		Be an Original Work
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		No google images finds or photographs from dinosaur books. The
		image should be something that you have created.
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		Be in a 16:9 ratio
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		This is the standard size for widescreen and works pretty well
		for most dinosaurs. If your image is not in this ratio it will
		be stretched by the browser. Examples include: 1280x720,
		1920x1080.
	</p>
	
	<img class="image_contribution_guideline_image" src="alt_images/image contribution guidelines/ratio.jpg" />
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		Have a pure white background
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		This is so that the image goes nicely onto the background of the
		viewer rather than having a visible border. If your image is a
		photgraph of a drawing or model you will have to use software to
		create a white background. A soft eraser tool is recommended.
	</p>
	
	<img class="image_contribution_guideline_image" src="alt_images/image contribution guidelines/background.jpg" />
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		Face rightwards and be in profile
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		This is so that it comes "outwards" from the evolutionary tree
		and faces the human in the size comaprison window. Being in
		profile also helps the size comparison to make more sense.
	</p>
		
	<img class="image_contribution_guideline_image" src="alt_images/image contribution guidelines/facing.jpg" />
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		Be flush to the sides and bottom. If it touches the top and
		bottom before the edges, it must be centralised
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		This is so that the size comparison vs a human makes the most
		sense.
	</p>
		
	<img class="image_contribution_guideline_image" src="alt_images/image contribution guidelines/flush.jpg" />
	
	<h3 class="image_contribution_guideline_title">
		Not contain a name, but can contain a signature
	</h3>
	
	<p class="image_contribution_guideline_paragraph">
		The name is already displayed in the viewer, so displaying it
		twice looks silly. You are, however, perfectly entitled and
		encouraged to add your signature to an image.
	</p>
