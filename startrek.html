<h2>Notes:</h2>
The cast and script is subject to change and discussion. We'll hopefully get to chat about things over Skype.
We'll hopefully get to do this when we come round. I'll keep the outtakes to put the best ones at the end of the video. I'll edit the video when we get home.
This website is private and your names aren't public, so don't worry. Yes, this is just another one of my crazy ideas.
<h1>Script (so far):</h1>
</body>

</html>

Stewart (camera on lego enterprise): Capain's log, stardate 40123.3. We have discovered yet another planet with an atmosphere similar to that of Earth. We will beam down a landing party of myself, first officer Scouse and Dr Snotty.
<BR/>
Stewart (on bridge): Standard orbit, number two
<BR/>
Number Two: Aye, sir
<BR/>
Stewart (in transporter room): Energise, Jan.
<BR/>
Jan: I say, rather. (Movie clip of empty transporter for teleport special effect)
<BR/>
Oss (on planet): Bonjour!
<BR/>
Scouse: There's something up with the universal translator, captain!
<BR/>
Stewart (winking): The name's Stew.
<BR/>
Snotty: Readings show that this is a Gromulan, identical in every way to humans, except for that their left kidney is where their right kidney should be, and their right kidney is where their left kidney should be.
