<H5>scene 1:</H5>
Stewart (camera on lego enterprise): Capain's log, stardate 40123.3. We have discovered yet another planet with an atmosphere similar to that of Earth. We will beam down a landing party of Myself, First Officer Scouse and Dr dotty.
<BR/>

<BR/>
Number Two: Aye, sir.
<BR/>
<H5>scene 2:</H5>

<BR/>
<H5>scene 3:</H5>
Oss (on planet): Bonjour!
<BR/>
Scouse: There's something up with the universal translator, Captain!
<BR/>
Stewart (winking): The name's Stew.
<H5>scene 4:</H5>
<BR/>
Dotty: Readings show that this is a Gromulan, identical in every way to humans, except for that their left kidney is where their right kidney should be, and their right kidney is where their left kidney should be.
<BR/>
[Opening Credits]: [Star Trekkin'] Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-hour mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no chappie's gone before.
<BR/>
<H5>scene 5:</H5>
Jan (in the canteen): What do you think to the new food replicators?
<BR/>
Number two: Ugh no. Give me plastic cubes anyday.
<BR/>
Jan: Well, I dare say these sausages are most spiffing. Catching up with my German heritage and all of that rot, don't you know.
<BR/>
Number two: You're German?
<BR/>
Jan: Yes, old girl.
<BR/>
Number two: Oh.
<BR/>
<H5>scene 6:</H5>
Stewart: I think I have a phraser with my phaser in my pocket with a socket.
<BR/>
Scouse: I really think you nearly chanced upon the answer.
<BR/>
dotty: Alright you two clever cloggs, lets try it out.
<BR/>
<H5>scene 7:</H5>
Stewart (tapping away at keypad) : Erm.. let me see... what is your name... comment vous appelez-vous? (Pronounced as if it was english {badly})
<BR/>
Oss: Mon nom est Oss.
<BR/>
<H5>scene 8:</H5>
Stewart: Let me see.. I'm Captain Stewart Wilson of the USS Enterprise. We come in peace.
<BR/>
Stewart (reading from the device): Je suis le Capitaine Stewart Wilson de l'USS Enterprise. Nous venons en pièce.. I mean paix.
<BR/>
<H5>scene 9:</H5>
Oss: Dites-vous quoi, je vais utiliser mon traducteur dans ma poche. Il devrait traduire de Gromulan en anglais plutôt qu'en français.
<BR/>
Stewart: She said: Tell you what, I'll use my translator in my pocket. It should translate from Gromulan into English rather than French.
<BR/>
<H5>scene 10:</H5>
Scouse: Ah, okay (looks at phraser) I mean, Ah, ok. Ah, okay, it's the same in French.
<BR/>
Oss (takes device out of pocket): Ok, I'm glad we got that cleared up before our brains got smeared up.
</BR>
dotty: Not you too!
</BR>
Stewart: I'm sure it doesn't rhyme in Gromulan Dotty.
</BR>
<H5>scene 11:</H5>
Scouse: We're being attacked by clingfilm! [Roll of clingfilm hits Grace]
<BR/>
Stewart: I'd advise you to get a different colour shirt, and fast!

[Everyone is wrapped in clingfilm and looks annoyed]
<H5>scene 13:</H5>

<H5>scene 14:</H5>
Jan (on planet): Can't you just sort of.. You know.. Pull your way out?
<H5>scene 15:</H5>
[Everyone pulls their way out]
<BR/>
Scouse: Well... that was easier than I had expected!
<BR/>
Stewart: We could have just fired the main phaser banks for a precise number of milliseconds.
<BR/>
Oss: 23.4, to be excact.
<BR/>
[Dotty glares at Oss]
<BR/>
[Closing credits]
